# The monsters have learned how to mimic the voices of your friends.

## Information
Enemies will now learn the voices of your friends and be able to repeat them.

## Discord server: https://discord.gg/8VXmnSfENj

## Configuration
All players need the mod installed. This is a client-side mod. Make sure your mic is enabled in-game.

It can be configured through the config file in r2modman or manually in the .cfg file to enable/disable voices for specific creatures, and adjust the frequency of voice lines. The host's config will be automatically synced to other players in the lobby.
