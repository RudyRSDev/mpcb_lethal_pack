# ShipLoot
A mod for Lethal Company which reliably displays the total scrap value on the ship.

Currently, whenever you scan the scrap on your ship you have to position yourself just right to get
all loot on the screen at once. Even then, your scanner never picks up more than 16 things at once,
which makes it hard to tell whether you actually met the quota the further into the game you get.

This mod introduces a small new counter below the usual scrap total. It is displayed whenever you scan
from inside the ship and will always show the exact scrap total you currently own.
