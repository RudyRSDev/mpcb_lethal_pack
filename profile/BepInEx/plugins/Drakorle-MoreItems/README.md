# More Items

Simply allows to save games with more than 45 items. Up to 999 items will be saved.

No more items despawning when you save! It is particularly useful in addition with mods that supports more than 4 players, of if you spend all credits of a good run in items to avoid the on-death penalty. Just try to not abuse, maybe your computer won't like it if there are too many!

In case you don't see some items in the closet at reboot, please try to move it with 'B', they usually glitch inside.
