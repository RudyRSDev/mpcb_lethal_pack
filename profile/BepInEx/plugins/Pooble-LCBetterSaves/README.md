This mod lets you create saves beyond the original three by selecting "New Save" and hosting a game.

To rename a save, go into Online mode, select your save, enter something in the Lobby Name field, and then click the "I" button to the right of your save.

This mod reorganizes your saves at every opportunity, so you might notice your existing saves getting shuffled around.

I recommend backing up any precious saves you might have before installing this mod.
