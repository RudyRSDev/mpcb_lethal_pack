This mod makes it so whatever suit you equipped will automatically be saved! (Compatible with suit mods.)
Whenever you rejoin into a game, or host a new game, the mod will automatically re-equip your last used suit.

The mod requires the saved suit to be unlocked. 
Suits like the hazard suit will not automatically re-equip, unless the game you joined already has them unlocked.

It's completely client side as well. The host does not need to download it for proper functionality.

Note: Suits with the exact same name may cause minor issues, although non-game-breaking.
