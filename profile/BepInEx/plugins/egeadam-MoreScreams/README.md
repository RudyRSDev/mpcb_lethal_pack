# MoreScreams
BepInEx 5 Plugin for Lethal Company.
This modification allows you to hear players' voices for 2 seconds (adjustable) after they die.
So, you can hear your friends while they are screaming.

It also transmits voice on the walkie-talkie for 2 seconds after death.

It's my first mod for this game, so expect bugs.
