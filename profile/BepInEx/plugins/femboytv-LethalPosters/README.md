# Lethal Posters
Allows for editing of posters in the ship (also check out [LethalPaintings](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/femboytv/LethalPaintings/))

When making a mod for [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/) you have to put all your images in these two folders:
- `BepInEx/plugins/LethalPosters/posters/` (this is where the atlas textures with 5 posters go)
- `BepInEx/plugins/LethalPosters/tips/` (this is where all the textures for the "Tips for the job" poster go)

You can put as many images as you want, and the mod will pick random ones every time you land on a moon

You can also grab my personal auto crop tool [here](https://github.com/Atakku/lpg)
