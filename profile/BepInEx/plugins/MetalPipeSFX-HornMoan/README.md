# Horn Moan!

Replaces the Airhorn sound effect with the HIT moaning sound effect.

As of 2.0.0, the mod works as far as I can tell.

Hours of debugging to find out I used a . instead of a -.

Got my morse code all wrong ;)


Update 2.1.0

Confirms compatibility with v45

Some hopefull futureproofing.
