# Scaling Start Credits
After starting a new save and the host pulls the lever to start the game, this mod gives the party additional credits per person above a pre-configured threshold. By default, this mod gives 15 credits per extra player above 4 players.

For example, in a lobby of 6 players, 30 extra credits are given to the party once the host pulls the lever to start the game. That's 2 players above the 4 player threshold, so 2 lumps of 15 credits are added.

Only the host needs this installed. Will not affect games in which you are not host. Compatible with V45 and all other mods.

## Configuration
The threshold and amount given per extra person are configurable from the BepInEx/config/sunnobunno.scalingstartcredits.cfg file. Make sure to run the game with the mod installed at least once to generate this config. Only edit the config when the game is not running.
