# Mimics v1.1.1
### Adds a dangerous new monster to the game. Can you figure out what's real or will you be devoured?

## Information
Mimics disguise themselves as one thing in particular. Each mimic has one random imperfection from a pool of several imperfections that let you tell it apart from its regular counterpart. If you guess wrong, there's no escape.

## Configuration
Mimic spawn rate and difficulty can be modified through the config file generated after launching the mod at least once. I recommend turning the difficulty up to max.
