# Coroner

A plugin which overhauls the end-of-mission Performance Report with new information, including cause of death for any deceased players. There are some fun easter eggs thrown in too.

**NOTE:** [LC_API](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/2018/LC_API/) is an optional but highly recommended dependency!

## Demonstration

## Notice
- If [LC_API](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/2018/LC_API/) is installed, death reports will be more precise between players.
- This should support MoreCompany's overhauled results screen but it's currently not thoroughly tested.

## Upcoming
- More detailed information on specific causes of death.
- Additional bug fixes.
