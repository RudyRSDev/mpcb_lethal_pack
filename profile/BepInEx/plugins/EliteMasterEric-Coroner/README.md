# Coroner

A plugin which overhauls the end-of-mission Performance Report with new information, including cause of death for any deceased players. There are some fun easter eggs thrown in too.

Supports v45.

**NOTE:** [LC_API](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/2018/LC_API/) is an optional but highly recommended dependency!

## Notice
- Supports More Company's changes to the Performance Report.
- Does not support Bigger Company (they just straight up disable Performance Reports).

- More detailed information on specific causes of death.
- More variety in causes of death.
