A configurable client-side mod for Lethal Company that improves nameplate visibility and adds speaking indicators based on voice activity.

- Overhead speaking indicator lights up when a player speaks (can be tweaked/disabled)
- Nameplates follow the player's head when crouching
- Configurable nameplate scale (default: increases nameplate size by 50%)
- Configurable nameplate visibility distance (default: shows nameplates when players are no further than ~1 ship length away from you)

Mod config is stored in `BepInEx/config/taffyko.NameplateTweaks.cfg`.  
You can also edit it in r2modman, or in-game using a plugin like https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.ConfigurationManager/releases
