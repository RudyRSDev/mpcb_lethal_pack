## Overview

Welcome to Pinger, a groundbreaking plugin that introduces a dynamic pinging mechanic to enhance your gaming experience. Pinger allows all players to utilize a ping command by simply pressing Q on their keyboard.

Each ping lasts 10 seconds and a player can only have one ping at a time.
