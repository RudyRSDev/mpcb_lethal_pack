# VoiceHUD
BepInEx 5 Plugin for Lethal Company.
Displays the push-to-talk icon ingame when detecting voice activity.


###### Version 1.0.1:
Added a threshold of 0.01f so it doesn't blink on every small noise.

###### Version 1.0.2:
Added colors :)
If the icon is green, dogs shouldn't hear you from further than 5 meters, at least in my experience.
Might need some tuning with the values

###### Version 1.0.3:
Removed debug line

###### Version 1.0.4:
Volume colors are no longer default, now they can be enabled in BepInEx/config/VoiceHUD.cfg
