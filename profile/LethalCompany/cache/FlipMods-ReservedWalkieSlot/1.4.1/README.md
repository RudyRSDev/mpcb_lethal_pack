# ReservedWalkieSlot
<strong>Requires: <a href="https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/FlipMods/ReservedItemSlotCore/">ReservedItemSlotCore</a></strong><br>
This mod gives you a free, dedicated item slot for Walkie Talkies.<br>
Now your teammates will have no excuse to not to bring a Walkie with them!<br>
These item slots are aligned on the right side of the screen, and stack vertically with my other ReservedItemSlot mods, such as the ReservedFlashlightSlot mod.<br>
<br>
You cannot switch to these slots manually by scrolling. Instead, the method for swapping to these items is to hold Alt, and scrolling up and down to switch between them.<br>
This way, you can swap to these items to drop them, as well as other actions, such as charging, storing, etc.<br>
<br>
You can activate and speak into walkie anytime by holding X, and with any item in your hands.<br>
This hotkey can be changed in the config.<br>
<br>
The walkie straps nicely your your chest when not in your hand. (patch 1.3.0)
