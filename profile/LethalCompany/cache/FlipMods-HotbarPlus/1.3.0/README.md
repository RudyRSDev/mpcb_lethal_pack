# HotbarPlus
- This mod give many quality of life improvements to the hotbar.<br>
- The number of hotbar slots is fully customizable. (almost fully, as in going below 4 may currently cause issues with the UI)<br>
- This mod adds numeric hotkeys for your hotbar slots. This can be disabled in the config.<br>
- The hotbar scroll direction has been inverted to be like most other games. This can be disabled in the config.<br>
- Swapping between hotbar slots is much faster. There used to be a decent delay.<br>
- The emote keys have been rebound to F1 and F2. These can be edited in the config.<br>
- Many forced delays between various events has been shortened, such as item swapping, discarding, interacting, activating items, etc.<br>
- Added the option for quick dropping. (still needs tweaks) You can now chain drop items. After dropping an item, you will automatically switch to another item on your hotbar.<br>

# All clients are synced!
- All clients will have their hotbar size synced with the host, regardless of their config. Equality!<br>
- Clients will have their currently selected hotbar slot synced with each other, even when swapping slots with the numerical hotkeys.<br>
- Swapping hotbar slots will sync perfectly with any set hotbar size.<br>
