# LethalAdjustments
Lets you adjust different internal values via config

All config files are in the `config/LethalAdjustments/` folder

Currently there are 3 config files which let you adjust 3 values:

- `MapSize.cfg` adjusts the multiplier for the total length of the generated map (not size, but length from the main entrance to the emergency exit afaik)

- `ScrapAmount.cfg` adjusts the multiplier for the **amount** of the scrap **spawned** on the map

- `ScrapValue.cfg` adjusts the multiplier for the **value** of the scrap **spawned** on the map (does not affect scrap you already picked up)
