# ReservedItemSlotCore
<strong>The core mod for all ReservedItemSlot mods.</strong><br>
This mod is required for my ReservedItemSlot mods to work, such as ReservedFlashlightSlot and ReservedWalkieSlot.<br>
These mods will give you free dedicated inventory slots for their respective item(s). These slots will be shown on the right side of your screen, stacking vertically.<br>
<br>
You cannot switch to these slots manually by scrolling. Instead, the method for swapping to these items is to hold Alt, and scrolling up and down to switch between them. (patch 1.2.1)<br>
This way, you can swap to these items to drop them, as well as other actions, such as charging, storing, etc.<br>
<br>
Grabbing reserved items, as well as switching between the main hotbar and reserved hotbar slots should sync between clients using this mod. (patch 1.2.5)<br>
If relevant, these mods will have dedicated keybinds to activate the items without needing to have them currently selected.<br>
