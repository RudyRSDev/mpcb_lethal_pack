# Mimics v1.1.0
### Adds a dangerous new monster to the game. Can you figure out what's real or will you be devoured?

## Information
Each mimic has one of several possible imperfections to differentiate itself from its mundane counterpart. If you guess wrong, there's no escape.

## Configuration
Mimic spawn rate and difficulty can be modified through the config file generated after launching the game at least once. I recommend turning the difficulty up to max.
