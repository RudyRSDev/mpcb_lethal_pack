# Elad's HUD

Replaces your health stamina and battery with better UI. 

# **PREVIOUS USERS, UNINSTALL THE MOD BEFORE UPDATING.**

Objectively.

## 1.1

- Added a separate element for unequipped, active flashlights.
- Layout adjustments.
- The stamina bar now turns red when you are unable to initiate a sprint.
- Healthbar now disappears automatically for added immersion.

A note that the Push-to-talk element may be obscured, as the UI was not designed with it in mind. May fix later.
