# Remote Remaster
Completly rewrite the function of the remote controller.
By default you could turn on and off the lights on the ship, this mod
changes this function to disable the closest turret and/or landmine.

# How to use
1. You have to find a remote controller.
2. Left click with the controller in your hand

Thats it, not that complicated right? :D
You should know that you have to get close to a turret or landmine to disable it.
(15 meter)

# Installation
1. Install BepInEx
2. Run game once with BepInEx installed to generate folders/files
3. Drop the DLL inside of the BepInEx/plugins folder
4. Enjoy. :)
