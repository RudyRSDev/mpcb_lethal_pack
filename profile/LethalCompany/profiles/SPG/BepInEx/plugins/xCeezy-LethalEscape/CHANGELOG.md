# Lethal Escape 0.5

Mod released! Yippe :D

# Lethal Escape 0.7
Coil head can go outside
Enemies now shouldnt go through ship door
All AIs of the same type escape when 1 escapes
AIs now teleport to door that is closest to a player outside rather than only the main door
If an AI outside gets stuck they now teleport to the closest node
If the exit door is not next to a ainode it now teleports to the closest node
Added fail safes just incase the AI state of being outside desyncs
cleared all the annoying debug logs

# Lethal Escape 0.7.1
Added changed logs

# Lethal Escape 0.7.2
Because coil head lacks a Start event for now I will just make them spawn outside
Fixed certain AIs fail safe not working due to it being on the wrong event

# Lethal Escape 0.7.3
Fixed hoarding bug AI (whoops)
