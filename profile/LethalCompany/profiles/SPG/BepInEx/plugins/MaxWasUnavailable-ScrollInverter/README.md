# Scroll Inverter

Exactly as it says in the name: a simple mod that inverts the scroll direction of the item slots bar.

Should be compatible with most (if not all) mods.

> Client-side mod: This mod only impacts the player that installed it, and does not affect other players or the game in any way. It can be used on other servers without any issues.

> Requires BepInEx
