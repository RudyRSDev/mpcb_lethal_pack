This mod uses BepinEx, LethalLib, and HookGenPatcher.

Installing the Mod:
    You can merge the included BepInEx folder with your existing BepInExFolder (".../common/Lethal Company/BepInEx").
    Ensure the MoreShipUpgrades folder is in ".../Lethal Company/BepInEx/plugins" and contains both 'shipupgrades' file and 'MoreShipUpgrades.dll'.
