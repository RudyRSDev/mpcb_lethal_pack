# FasterItemDropship
Makes the Item Dropship arrive and leave faster.<br>
The Item Dropship will arrive within 10 seconds of buying items, and will depart after 3 seconds of opening the dropship doors, or after 40 seconds, whichever is sooner.<br>
Buying items while the dropship landing, but before it has fully lands, will add the items to its inventory so you don't have to wait for the next dropship.<br>
All settings can now be edited in the config!
