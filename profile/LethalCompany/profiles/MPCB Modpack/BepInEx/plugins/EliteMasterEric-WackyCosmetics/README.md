An addon for More Company which adds a variety of zany and interesting new cosmetics.

# Notice
If playing on a save that previously had the BiggerLobby mod, you may encounter significantly more instability issues than usual. I recommend playing it safe and wiping BiggerLobby saves and making new MoreCompany ones. 

# Upcoming (Potentially)
- Additional cosmetics.
