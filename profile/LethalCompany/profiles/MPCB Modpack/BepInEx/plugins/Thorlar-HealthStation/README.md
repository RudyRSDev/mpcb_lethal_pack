# Health Station
A mod for Lethal Company which makes you get full health when using the Item Charger

This is my first mod, so my apologies if it's a bit weird or broken. Currently working with
a mechanic that "reverse hurts" the player to full health since the game doesn't feature any
healing mechanic, which is why it looks and sounds like the player takes damage upon being
healed by the charger but if you look at your health it should now be fully restored. I'm
also kinda liking the idea that it does that since you're getting an electric shock that
heals, but let me know if you'd like to see that "hurt animation" removed. :)

Version 1.0.1 update:
Fixed a bug where if you got critically hurt and healed you would still be slow.
