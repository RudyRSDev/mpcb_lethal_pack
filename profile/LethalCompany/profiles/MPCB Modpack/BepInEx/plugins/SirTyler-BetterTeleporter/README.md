# BetterTeleporter


## Features

- Inverse Teleporation does not drop **Keys**, **Flashlights**, or **Walkie-Talkies**.
- **Flashlight** and **Walkie-Talkie** lose *50%* of their current charge upon teleporting.

## To-Do

- Set up configuration files for features and values.
- Synchronize host-config across all clients.
- Apply some configurable changes to normal teleporation as-well.

## Installation

Install like any other BepInEx mod. Install to the following directory:

```
  \{GAME_LOCATION}\Lethal Company\BepInEx\plugins
```

#### Can I contribute somehow?
